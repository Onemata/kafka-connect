# kafka-connect

## Getting Started

1. To get started you'll want to install Docker for your OS:
- https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/
- https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/
- https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux

2. After Docker is installed and running on your machine you call pull this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Onemata/kafka-connect.git`

3. From there if you're just playing or in development `docker-compose up --build` will build the container and start the kafka stack in your command line window so you can easily see the output as things connect and run.
